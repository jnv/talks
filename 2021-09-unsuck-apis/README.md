## Giving presentations

You can advance slides the usual way, by clicking them. You can also use the left & right arrow keys, and the up and down arrow keys. On touch devices, you can navigate forward by tapping and also navigate forward and backwards by swiping.

Big also has three modes if you want to quickly jump to a slide, or print a presentation. You can switch between modes by hitting the `t`, `p`, and `j` keys.

- **t**alk is the default mode. Slides are shown one at a time.
- **p**rint: is useful for print output or as an overview: it'll include
  two slides per printed page, and shows speakers notes along with slides
- **j**ump: Shows many slides per page, useful for quickly finding a slide and 'jumping' to it. When you're in jump mode, you can use the arrow keys to quickly select a slide and hit Enter to jump to that slide, or click the
  slide you want.
